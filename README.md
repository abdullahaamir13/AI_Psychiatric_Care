# AI in Psychiatric Care: Early Detection and Personalized Intervention

This repository hosts the research paper "AI in Psychiatric Care: Early Detection and Personalized Intervention," a collaborative effort by students from the CS Department at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Peshawar. The paper explores the potential of AI in revolutionizing psychiatric care through early detection and personalized interventions using multimodal data.

## Overview

- **Authors**: M Abdullah Aamir (Leader), Mustafa, Misbah, Saim, Hamza, M Abdullah, Abdullah Bilal, Zaigham, Abdullah, Hashim, Sultan, Ahmed, Faran
- **Institution**: National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Peshawar
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: June 2025
- **Focus**: Leveraging AI (machine learning, deep learning, NLP) to analyze speech, text, physiological signals, and neuroimaging for early detection of disorders like depression and anxiety, with personalized intervention strategies.

As the leader of this research, I (M Abdullah Aamir) coordinated the team, oversaw the integration of diverse data sources, and ensured the paper addressed ethical challenges and future directions. The paper is compiled into `AI_Psychiatric_Care_Research_Paper.pdf`.

## Current Work: MVP Chatbot for Local Mental Health (Pakistan)

Building on this research, I am currently developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) chatbot tailored for local mental health support in Pakistan. The chatbot aims to:
- Provide early detection of mental health issues using text and voice inputs.
- Offer personalized coping strategies and referrals to local resources.
- Address cultural nuances and accessibility challenges in underserved regions.

This MVP is in the early stages, focusing on integrating NLP techniques and simple AI models to support users in Urdu and English, with plans for real-time monitoring and scalability.

## Prerequisites

- **For PDF**: Any PDF viewer (e.g., Adobe Reader, browser).

## Usage

- **View the Research Paper**: Open `AI_Psychiatric_Care_Research_Paper.pdf` to explore the study findings, methodologies, and ethical considerations.
- **Follow Chatbot Progress**: Stay tuned for updates on the MVP chatbot, with future releases or demos to be shared here.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! As the leader, I encourage:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m "Description of changes"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
