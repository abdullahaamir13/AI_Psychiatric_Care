# AI in Psychiatric Care: Early Detection and Personalized Intervention

This repository hosts the research paper "AI in Psychiatric Care: Early Detection and Personalized Intervention," a collaborative effort by students from the CS Department at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Peshawar. The paper explores the potential of AI in revolutionizing psychiatric care through early detection and personalized interventions using multimodal data.

## Overview

- **Authors**: M Abdullah Aamir (Leader), Mustafa, Misbah, Saim, Hamza, M Abdullah, Abdullah Bilal, Zaigham, Abdullah, Hashim, Sultan, Ahmed, Faran
- **Institution**: National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Peshawar
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: June 2025
- **Focus**: Leveraging AI (machine learning, deep learning, NLP) to analyze speech, text, physiological signals, and neuroimaging for early detection of disorders like depression and anxiety, with personalized intervention strategies.

As the leader of this research, I (M Abdullah Aamir) coordinated the team, oversaw the integration of diverse data sources, and ensured the paper addressed ethical challenges and future directions. The paper is compiled into `AI_Psychiatric_Care_Research_Paper.pdf`.

## Current Work: PsychCareAI - Mental Health Analysis Platform

[PsychCareAI](https://github.com/abdullahaamir13/PsychCareAI) is an interactive web-based application designed to analyze mental health data and predict psychiatric disorders using advanced machine learning models. Built with **Streamlit**, the platform enables real-time psychiatric risk profiling, model-driven diagnosis support, and clinical reporting.

### üîç Key Features
- **Patient Data Input**: Collects clinical, behavioral, demographic, and NLP-derived data.
- **Risk Assessment**: Computes multi-domain psychiatric risk using patient indicators.
- **ML-Based Predictions**: Integrates models like **CatBoost**, **LightGBM**, **XGBoost**, and **Random Forest** to forecast psychiatric conditions.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays system health, model metrics, and activity logs.
- **AI Chatbot (MVP)**: Early-stage bilingual chatbot (English/Urdu) for patient interaction and symptom capture.
